								 The best offline alternative is the Career fair. Career fairs happen annually or bi-

                        representative of sites. Generally, career fairs are good, but expensive to organize. The system
                        would provide best and cheap alternative to such events. It provide all the information online so
                        have broader range of users. Online medium of communication are fast, cheap and very
                        effective.

									<li>The system currently been used at PSU manages and assign sites to interns. We

                        internship records of student are not recorded. Also, when student wants to know
                        information regarding their assigned internship sites, they have to personally
                        contact previous students. If we could provide platform to share their
                        experiences, it would be easy to get the information.

                        internship programs to students.The system provide platform for communication
                        between sites and students.

                        valuable information about students and internship sites. Everyone have to
                        registers except anonymous observer/visitor.

									<li>
										As the system going to use online medium (i.e. emails), everyone who registers
                        must have usable email account. Valid email account is must. Though the
                        system will include all the valuable information along with view restriction, email
                        are used for confirmation and authentication of inputted information.
