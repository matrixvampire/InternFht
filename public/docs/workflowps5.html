			<tr><td>Build enough of the pages so that a group of users can cooperate to put a few pieces of content live on your server. Focus your efforts on the primary kinds of publisher-authored content that you expect to have in your online learning community. For most projects, this will be articles and navigation pages to those articles. </td></tr>
			<tr><td>After you've got a few articles in, step back and ask the following questions: </td></tr>
			<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Q1: Is this data model working? <font color='green'><i>Yes</i></font></td></tr>
			<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Q2: Is it taking a reasonable number of clicks to get some content live? <font color='green'><i>Yes</i></font></td></tr>
    		<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Q3: Do the people who need to approve new content have an easy way of figuring out what needs approval and what has been approved or rejected already? Must those editors come to the site every few hours and check or will they get email alerts when new content needs review? <font color='green'><i>Yes, the adminstrator will send email to them notify about their contents.</i></font></td></tr>
			<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
			<tr><td>A skeletal implementation should have stable and consistent URLs, i.e., the home page should be just the hostname of the server and filenames should be consistent. If you haven't had a chance to make abstract URLs work (see the "Basics" chapter), this is a good time to do it. Every page should have a descriptive title so that the browser's Back button and bookmarks ("favorites") are fully functional. <font color='green'><i>Every page should have a "View Source" link at the bottom and a way to contact the persons responsible for page function and content</i></font>. Some sort of consistent navigation system should be in place (also see below). The look and feel of a skeletal implementation will be plain, but it need not be ugly or inconsistent. Look to Google for inspiration, not the personal home pages of fellow students at your university. </td></tr>
